/*
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into
lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.
Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

//your code here...

//remove white space and  punctuation from string
//if string empty return true
//start and end pointers
//compare both pointers
//if different return false
